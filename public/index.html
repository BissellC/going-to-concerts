    <h1>Going to Concerts</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Charlie and a hobby of mine is going to concerts.  I love forgetting everything and going crazy to the music.  The first concert I went to was Green Day about ten years ago.  My Dad took me and at the time I thought it was lame to go to a concert with my Dad, but now I appreciate it. These days I go to shows in Ybor city, I love to see that Tampa has a good music scene.</p>

    <footer>Most of my life when I went to concerts they drew X's on my hands. I turned drinking age recently and I'm glad because <a href= "images/beer.gif"> beer and concerts are a great combination!</a></footer>
